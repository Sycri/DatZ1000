					<p>
							This is the intersection where I end up waiting the longest because each of the three pedestrian crossings has a traffic light. Sometimes I'm lucky to arrive when the light is green, but during the time of taking this picture, it didn't happen, so I stopped at this location.
					</p>
					<p>
							Once I've waited for all the traffic lights, crossed all the pedestrian crossings, and can continue riding, I travel along the wide pedestrian path of Raņķis' Embankment, cross Nameja's Waterfront, and reach the next image location.

					<img src="../images/Bike4.webp" alt="Olympia shopping center at the pedestrian crossing" width="510" height="384" class="img-full-width">
					<p>
							In this image, you can already see the Olimpia shopping center, where I have been several times. I don't go there now, but if I don't take an alternative route, which is across Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street opposite this center, I pass by it.
					</p>
					<p>
							The most challenging part is probably getting onto the pedestrian path of Vanšu Bridge. The path on this side is steeper than the other side, so sometimes I take the alternative route. In any case, during the summer, there are many cyclists and other electric vehicles, such as electric scooters, on the bridge, so one has to be careful not to collide with any of them or with pedestrians.
