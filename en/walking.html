			If you've read the homepage, then you already know that unfortunately, I haven't completed the full journey from home to the University of Latvia. However, I want to show at least the route that I take twice a week for my C courses, walking from my workplace to the building of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, located at Aspazijas bulvāris 5. The images should be viewed from left to right and then from top to bottom.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the first image, I have already started my walk and am located in the park, hence the visible trees. If you look closer, you can notice the backside of the Rainis Monument. It's interesting to walk by and see something that used to feel completely different to me years ago.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the way to the Freedom Monument, in the second image, I have taken a photo of a couple of boats that are visible in the water. It's already approaching summer at this time. I didn't see them at all during autumn or even at the beginning of spring.
		</p>
		<p>
			When we look at the third image, I have already passed by the Freedom Monument, but I have taken a photo of a special building called the Latvian National Opera. I have never been inside, but based on the pictures I have seen online, it looks impressive.
		</p>
		<p>
			We reach our destination in the fourth image. We can see the building of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia. I particularly like that there is a tram stop for Tram 1 very close by, which I only need to use to go back home. Maybe someday I will travel from home to this place instead of from this place to home.
