						Usually, I start by going to the intersection of Dzirciema Street and Jūrmala Street, near the Botanical Garden of the University of Latvia. I took this picture when I stopped at the traffic light. In the distance, you can see a Circle K gas station, behind which there is also a parcel pick-up point where I often collect packages. If you were looking in the opposite direction of the image, you could notice the Maksima store, next to which there is another parcel pick-up point, as well as the Riga Post Office No. 83.
				</p>
				<p>
						Next to this intersection, from the perspective of the image, on the left, is the Jurmalas Gatve Bridge. It has been a part of my daily life, and every morning I see cars and public transportation crossing it.
				</p>
				<p>
						Continuing in the direction of the post office, I would reach the secondary school where I graduated: Riga State German Grammar School.
				</p>
				<p>
						When the pedestrian traffic light turned green, I continued along the Botanical Garden of the University of Latvia until I reached the next location in the image.

							Whether by bike or public transport, I pass by Sloka Street. At first, I didn't really know this street, but later I started biking and became familiar with it.
					</p>
					<p>
							On the left side of the image, you can see the café Ciemakukulis, where I occasionally go in for a coffee or a bacon bread snack on my way back. Recently, I discovered a shorter route to get back home, so sometimes I skip the entire Sloka Street on the way back.
					</p>
					<p>
							When the traffic light shown in the image switches from red to green, I cross the street to continue along Kuldīga Street, Durbe Street, and stop at the intersection shown in the next image.
