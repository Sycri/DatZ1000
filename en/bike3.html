							Here, I have already descended from Vanšu Bridge. The spot where I descend is very narrow, and practically only one cyclist can go up or down at a time. I have almost collided with someone there several times, so I ride quite slowly in that area.
					</p>
					<p>
							Overall, I'm not very familiar with the locations shown in the image. I just have to enter here, cross the street, and turn right to continue my journey.
					</p>
					<p>
							Once, while crossing the street, I tried to go left instead of turning right, but I got lost and had to use my phone to figure out how to proceed. Now I always turn right, but I still consider other possibilities for a different route sometimes.

							Between this and the previous image, I pass by the Latvian National Theatre, but I didn't take a picture of it for my bike route. Fortunately, I could capture it when <a href="public_transport.html">traveling by public transport</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
							In this image, I'm almost at the Latvian National Art Museum, but that's not my final destination. Every day, I have two possible destinations: the University of Latvia on Rainis' Boulevard 19 or my workplace on Elizabete Street. Depending on the day and lecture times, I choose where to go next.
